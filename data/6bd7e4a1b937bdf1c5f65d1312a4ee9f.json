Python allows mandatory and optional arguments, keyword arguments, and even arbitrary argument lists. More about defining functions in Python 3 # Python 3: List comprehensions >>> fruits = ['Banana', 'Apple', 'Lime']\r\n>>> loud_fruits = [fruit.upper() for fruit in fruits]\r\n>>> print(loud_fruits) ['BANANA', 'APPLE', 'LIME'] # List and the enumerate function >>> list(enumerate(fruits)) [(0, 'Banana'), (1, 'Apple'), (2, 'Lime')] Compound Data Types Lists (known as arrays in other languages) are one of the compound data types that Python understands. Lists can be indexed, sliced and manipulated with other built-in functions. More about lists in Python 3 # Python 3: Simple arithmetic >>> 1 / 2 0.5 >>> 2 ** 3 8 >>> 17 / 3 # classic division returns a float 5.666666666666667 >>> 17 // 3 # floor division 5 Intuitive Interpretation Calculations are simple with Python, and expression syntax is straightforward: the operators + , - , * and / work as expected; parentheses () can be used for grouping. More about simple math functions in Python 3 . # For loop on a list >>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]\r\n>>> product = 1\r\n>>> for number in numbers:\r\n...    product = product * number\r\n... \r\n>>> print('The product is:', product) The product is: 384 All the Flow You’d Expect Python knows the usual control flow statements that other languages speak — if , for , while and range — with some of its own twists, of course. More control flow tools in Python 3 # Simple output (with Unicode) >>> print(\"Hello, I'm Python!\") Hello, I'm Python! # Input, assignment >>> name = input('What is your name?\\n') What is your name?\r\nPython >>> print(f'Hi, {name}.')
